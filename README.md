# CO-NNECT
This repository contains our path generation framework Co-NNECT, in which we combine two models for establishing knowledge relations and paths between concepts from sentences, as a form of explicitation of implicit knowledge: COREC-LM (COmmonsense knowledge RElation Classification using Language Models), a relation classification system that we developed for classifying commonsense knowledge relations (CO-NNECT/COREC-LM); and COMET, a target prediction system developed by Bosselut et al., 2019, which we adapt for Forwardchaining (CO-NNECT/Forwardchaining).
